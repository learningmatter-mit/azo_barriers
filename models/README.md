# Pre-trained models
Here you can find pre-trained models. Each directory has sub-directories `0`, `1`, etc., for models initialized with different random seeds and trained on different splits. 

Directories starting with "singlet" are $S_0$ singlet models, and directories starting with "triplet" are $T_1$ triplet models. "exclude_specs_w_exp" refers to models trained on all species except those with experimental data. These were used in the paper to test the agreement of the models with experiment for unseen spsecies. `s0_s1` is a model trained on $S_0/S_1$ gaps.
